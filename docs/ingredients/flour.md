# Flour

Flour is the foundation of nearly every dough. Its protein content determines how much gluten can form, which affects structure, chew, and oven spring.

## Types of Flour

### **Bread Flour (High-Protein)**
Most KitchenRatio recipes use **bread flour** because:
- Higher protein = stronger gluten network  
- Better rise and oven spring  
- Easier shaping  
- More tolerance to high hydration  

Typical protein content: **12–13%**

### **All-Purpose Flour**
- Lower protein (10–11%)  
- Softer crumb  
- Can be used for rolls or enriched doughs  
- May feel stickier at the same hydration

### **Whole Wheat Flour**
- Absorbs more water  
- Reduces extensibility  
- Adds flavor and fiber  
- Often blended 10–50% with white flour

## How Flour Affects the Dough

- **Protein** → Strength and chew  
- **Ash content** → Flavor and fermentation behavior  
- **Hydration absorption** → How sticky or stiff the dough feels  

High-protein bread flour is recommended for:
- Baguettes  
- Pizza dough  
- Hoagie rolls  
- Most lean doughs

## Tips
- Use the **same brand** of bread flour consistently for predictable hydration.  
- If switching flours, adjust hydration by **±2–5%**.  
- For softer rolls, blend **80% bread flour + 20% AP**.
