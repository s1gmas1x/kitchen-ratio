# Water

Water hydrates the flour, activates the yeast, and determines dough extensibility. Hydration percentage is one of the most important baker’s-percentage concepts.

## Why Water Quality Matters

### **Filtered Water (Recommended)**
- More neutral flavor  
- No chlorine to slow fermentation  
- More consistent dough texture  

### **Tap Water**
- Safe and totally usable  
- Chlorine may *slightly* reduce yeast activity  
- Hardness varies by location, which impacts dough feel

If in doubt: **filtered is ideal**, but tap works fine for everyday baking.

## Hydration

Hydration percentage controls:
- Stickiness  
- Open crumb  
- Oven spring  
- Dough handling

## Tips
- Warmer water speeds fermentation; colder water slows it.  
- If dough is tearing instead of stretching, increase hydration by **1–2%**.  
- For whole wheat doughs, increase hydration **4–8%**.
