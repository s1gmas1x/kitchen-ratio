# Yeast

Yeast produces carbon dioxide and helps dough rise. Different types behave slightly differently, but all can make excellent bread when used correctly.

## Types of Yeast

### **Instant Yeast**
- Can be mixed directly into flour  
- Strong, reliable  
- Smaller granules

### **Active Dry Yeast**
- Larger granules  
- Must be hydrated before use  
- Hydrate in water for **10 minutes** before mixing  

### **Fresh Yeast (Cake Yeast)**
- 70% water content (soft and crumbly)  
- More perishable  
- Calculator automatically adjusts hydration when using it

## How Yeast Affects Dough

### **More Yeast**
- Faster fermentation  
- Shorter proofing window  
- More risk of over-proofing

### **Less Yeast**
- Slower fermentation  
- Better flavor development  
- Better for cold-fermented doughs

## Tips
- Store instant yeast in the fridge or freezer for long life.  
- When using active dry: hydrate in **warm (not hot)** water.  
- Fresh yeast is great for delicate enriched doughs but must stay cold.
