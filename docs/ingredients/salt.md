# Salt

Salt regulates fermentation, strengthens gluten, and improves flavor. It’s one of the most important ingredients in any bread dough.

## Typical Baker’s Percentage
Most bread doughs use **2% salt**, which is:
- Enough for flavor  
- Helps tighten gluten  
- Controls fermentation speed  
- Standard across most professional formulas  

All KitchenRatio recipes use ~**2%** unless otherwise noted.

## How Salt Affects Dough

### **Strengthens Gluten**
Salt tightens protein bonds, helping dough hold shape.

### **Slows Fermentation**
Higher salt concentration inhibits yeast activity.

- At **2%** → Normal  
- Above **2.3–2.5%** → Noticeably slower rise  
- At **3%+** → Yeast may struggle  

### **Improves Flavor**
Salt balances wheat flavor and prevents bland dough.

## Tips
- Don’t let salt touch yeast directly when mixing — mix into flour first.  
- If dough is rising too fast, increase salt by **0.2–0.3%**.  
- For low-salt diets, reduce to **1.5%**, but expect faster fermentation.
