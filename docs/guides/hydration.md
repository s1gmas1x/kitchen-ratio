# Dough Hydration

Hydration is the ratio of water to flour in a dough. It affects the texture, handling, and crumb of the bread.

- **Low hydration (<60%)**: stiff dough, dense crumb  
- **Medium hydration (60-70%)**: balanced crumb, easier handling  
- **High hydration (>70%)**: wet dough, open crumb, more challenging to shape

**Tip:** High hydration doughs benefit from gentle folding during bulk fermentation to build structure.
