# Dough Hydration

Hydration is the ratio of total water in a recipe to the total amount of flour.  
This ratio affects how the dough feels, how it behaves during mixing and folding, and what the final crumb looks like.

**Hydration % = (Total Water in the Dough ÷ Total Flour) × 100**

## What Counts as “Water” in This Calculator

In this system, hydration includes **all ingredients that contribute water**, not just plain water:

- Water  
- Milk and cream  
- **Eggs (about 75% water)**  
- **Butter (about 18% water)**  
- Other liquids with measurable water content

This gives a more accurate picture of how wet the dough truly is, especially in enriched breads.

## Hydration Levels

### **Low Hydration (< 60%)**
- Firm, stiff dough  
- Easy to shape  
- Tight crumb (bagels, pretzels, sandwich loaves)

### **Medium Hydration (60–70%)**
- Soft, workable dough  
- Balanced crumb  
- Great all-purpose range for beginners

### **High Hydration (> 70%)**
- Wet, sticky dough  
- Open, airy crumb  
- Harder to handle  
- **Tip:** Use gentle folding during bulk fermentation to build strength—especially for no-knead doughs.

## Why Hydration Matters
Hydration influences:
- Mixing difficulty  
- Dough strength  
- Extensibility (how far the dough can stretch)  
- Crumb openness  
- Crust thickness

Once you know hydration, you can compare recipes more clearly and predict how a dough will feel before you start mixing.
Experiment with different hydration levels to find what works best for your baking style and the breads you love!
