# Enriched Doughs

Enriched doughs include ingredients like fats, sugar, eggs, and dairy. These additions make the dough softer, richer, and more tender, and they influence both flavor and structure in different ways.

### How Enrichment Ingredients Affect Dough

- **Fats (oil, butter, shortening)**  
  Soften the crumb, improve tenderness, and slow staling. Higher-fat doughs stay soft longer and are easier to shape.

- **Sugar**  
  Adds sweetness, boosts browning, and provides extra food for yeast. It also helps the crumb stay moist.

- **Eggs**  
  Make the dough richer, add structure and color, and improve elasticity. Egg yolks contribute fat; egg whites add protein.

- **Milk & Dairy**  
  Add flavor, tenderness, and improved browning due to natural sugars and proteins. They also slightly tighten the crumb.

These enrichments can be used lightly or heavily depending on the style of dough. A hoagie roll may use just a touch of oil and sugar, while a brioche or certain pizza doughs can include much higher levels.

**Examples:** hoagie rolls, sandwich loaves, brioche, enriched-style pizza doughs.
