# Convert Recipes with the Calculator

Use the KitchenRatio calculator to convert a written recipe into baker’s percentages, then scale it without redoing the math.

## Step 1: Enter the Flour Weight
Set the Flour card to match the flour weight from your recipe. This becomes your 100% reference.

## Step 2: Match Ingredient Weights
Add the ingredients you need (water, salt, yeast, enrichments).  
Adjust each slider until the grams shown under the slider match your recipe’s weight.  
The calculator will show the percentage for each ingredient as you dial it in.

## Step 3: Capture the Ratio
Once all ingredient weights match, you now have the baker’s percentages for that recipe.  
Note the percentages shown under each ingredient, then scale by increasing or decreasing the flour amount.

## Step 4: Scale Up or Down
Keep the percentages fixed and change the flour weight.  
All ingredient grams update automatically for the new batch size.

## Example Workflow
1. Recipe flour is 500g → set Flour to 500g.  
2. Recipe water is 325g → adjust water slider until it shows 325g.  
3. Repeat for salt, yeast, and enrichments.  
4. Increase flour to 800g to scale the whole recipe.
