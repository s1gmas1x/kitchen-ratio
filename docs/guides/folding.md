# Folding (For No-Knead Dough)

With the **no-knead method**, you rely on long fermentation instead of kneading to build gluten. Folding is a quick, gentle step that gives the dough extra strength so it rises higher, bakes more evenly, and stays easier to handle.

Each fold takes only about 10 seconds, and you only need a few of them.

## Why Fold No-Knead Dough?

Folding helps:

- Strengthen gluten without kneading  
- Even out temperature and fermentation  
- Create a more open, consistent crumb  
- Keep wet dough manageable  
- Improve structure and oven spring  

---

## When to Fold

Right after mixing, the dough is soft, sticky, and shaggy—that’s normal.  
Begin folding **20–30 minutes after mixing**, then repeat a few times during the first hour.

**A typical no-knead schedule uses 2–4 folds spaced 20–30 minutes apart in the first 1 to 2 hours. After that, do one gentle fold per day during the long bulk fermentation, and give the dough a final fold the morning before you plan to shape and bake it.**

## How to Fold (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Mix the Dough  
After combining flour, water, salt, yeast (and any enrichments like butter or eggs, if used), let the dough rest for 20–30 minutes.

This rest allows the flour to hydrate and makes the first fold easier.

---

### 2. First Fold  
Wet your fingers or use a dough scraper:

1. Grab one edge of the dough and gently stretch it upward.  
2. Fold it down toward the center.  
3. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn.  
4. Repeat until you’ve folded all four sides.

Damp hands prevent sticking, no extra flour needed.

---

### 3. Repeat 2–3 More Times  
Do another fold every 20–30 minutes.

You’ll notice the dough becoming:

- smoother  
- stronger  
- more elastic  

This is exactly what you want.

## After Folding  
Once you finish the folding rounds, let the dough continue its bulk fermentation until it has risen noticeably and feels airy.

**Shaping will be covered in a separate guide.**
