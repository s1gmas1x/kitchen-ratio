# Folding & Shaping

Folding during bulk fermentation builds strength without aggressive kneading.

**Steps:**  
1. Stretch and fold every 30 minutes 2-4 times in the first 1-2 hours for cold-fermented dough  
2. Pre-shape rounds  
3. Rest 20–30 min  
4. Final shape into desired loaf or roll  
5. Proof until slightly puffy  
6. Score and bake
