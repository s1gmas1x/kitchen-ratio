# Folding & Shaping (For No-Knead Dough)

With the no-knead method, you let time do most of the work. Folding is the simple step that replaces kneading. A few gentle folds during the first hour help the dough build strength, stay smooth, and rise better in the oven.

Folding also evens out temperature and redistributes the yeast so fermentation stays on track. Once you get used to it, each fold takes only about 10 seconds.

## When and Why to Fold

In no-knead doughs, folding helps by:

- Strengthening the dough so it rises tall instead of spreading out  
- Encouraging more even air pockets  
- Keeping sticky, high-hydration dough easier to handle  
- Improving texture and crumb with almost no effort  

## Step-by-Step Folding Guide

### **1. Mix the Dough**
After combining flour, water, salt, and yeast, the dough will look sticky and rough. That’s exactly what no-knead dough should look like.

### **2. First Fold (20–30 Minutes After Mixing)**
Wet your fingers or use a scraper:

1. Grab one side of the dough and gently stretch it upward.  
2. Fold that section down toward the center.  
3. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn and repeat.  
4. Continue until you’ve folded all four sides.

No extra flour needed — damp hands prevent sticking.

### **3. Repeat a Few Times**
Repeat the folding every **20–30 minutes**, doing **2–4 rounds total**.  
Each fold smooths and strengthens the dough.

### **4. Pre-Shape**
Once bulk fermentation is done (the dough has risen and feels airy):

- Gently turn it out onto the counter  
- Tuck the edges toward the center to form a loose round  
- Let it rest 15–30 minutes so the gluten can relax

### **5. Final Shape**
Shape the dough into whatever you’re making a round loaf, long loaf, sandwich loaf, etc.  
Be gentle so you keep the air inside.

### **6. Proof, Score, and Bake**
Let the dough rise until slightly puffy, then score and bake according to your recipe.
