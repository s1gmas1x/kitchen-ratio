# KitchenRatio Calculator

The KitchenRatio calculator helps you scale doughs consistently using baker’s percentages. It’s designed for quick, repeatable adjustments without rewriting recipes. Access it at https://calculator.kitchenratio.com.

## Quick Start
1. Set the base flour weight in the Flour card using the increase/decrease buttons.  
2. Adjust water, salt, and yeast with their percentage sliders.  
3. Add enrichments or other ingredients with the Add Ingredient action.  
4. Review the computed grams and bake with the scaled recipe.

## Ingredient Cards
- Flour is the main ingredient and only uses increase/decrease buttons.  
- All other ingredients use sliders to adjust their percentage.  
- Enrichment and other add-ins can be inserted via Add Ingredient.

## Choosing Ratios
Use ratios that match the dough you want to make, then keep them constant while scaling:
- Hydration (water %) controls dough softness and handling.  
- Salt % affects flavor and fermentation rate.  
- Yeast % affects rise speed.  

Example ratios for a lean dough: 65% water, 2% salt, 0.5% yeast.

## Scaling Workflow
- Start with a known dough you like and set its ratios.  
- Use the Flour card to increase or decrease the batch.  
- Keep the sliders steady so the results stay predictable.

## Practical Tips
- Weigh ingredients in grams for accuracy.  
- If your recipe includes enrichments (oil, sugar, dairy, eggs, etc.), add them as percentages of flour.  
- Pair the calculator with guides like [Baker’s Percentage](/guides/bakers-percentage) to learn why the ratios work.
