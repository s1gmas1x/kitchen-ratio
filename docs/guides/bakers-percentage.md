# Baker's Percentage

Baker's percentage is a method of expressing ingredient ratios relative to flour.  

- Flour is always **100%**.  
- Water, yeast, salt, and other ingredients are expressed as percentages of the flour weight.

### Example

For a dough with:

- 500g flour  
- 325g water  
- 10g salt  

The baker's percentages are:

- Water: 325 ÷ 500 × 100 = 65%  
- Salt: 10 ÷ 500 × 100 = 2%  

Using baker's percentages allows scaling recipes easily and ensures consistent results.
