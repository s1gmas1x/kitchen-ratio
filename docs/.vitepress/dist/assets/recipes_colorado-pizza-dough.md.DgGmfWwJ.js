This recipe is based on that experience, along with a few adjustments I’ve always felt improved it.</p><p>The original dough used a slightly <strong>lower hydration</strong>, which worked well with a commercial dough sheeter. For home baking, increasing hydration improves:</p><ul><li>Extensibility</li><li>Handling (without a sheeter)</li><li>Crust texture - lighter, less dense, and more open</li></ul><p>If you want something closer to the restaurant version, simply reduce the hydration.<br> If you drop it <strong>below 65%</strong>, I recommend kneading for <strong>8–10 minutes</strong> after mixing.</p><hr><h2 id="ingredients-example-batch" tabindex="-1">Ingredients (Example Batch) <a class="header-anchor" href="#ingredients-example-batch" aria-label="Permalink to “Ingredients (Example Batch)”">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Flour</strong> - 450g</li><li><strong>Water</strong> - 306g (68% hydration)</li><li><strong>Yeast</strong> - 1.4g (0.3%)</li><li><strong>Olive oil</strong> - 32g (7%)</li><li><strong>Light malt powder</strong> - 5g (~1%)</li></ul><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title custom-block-title-default">INFO</p><p>This batch makes <strong>two to three 11-inch (“Medium”) pizzas</strong> depending on how thick you make the crust.
