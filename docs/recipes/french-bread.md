## Procedure

### 1. Mixing
- Combine flour, water, salt, and yeast until a rough dough forms.  
- No kneading needed - just hydrate everything thoroughly.

### 2. Bulk Fermentation (Cold)
- Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for **12–18 hours**.
- **Perform 2–3 folds every 30 minutes** during the first 1–1.5 hours. (This builds strength without kneading.)
- **Fold once more** 8 to 12 hours before baking (usually the morning of baking).

### 3. Pre-Shape
- Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface.  
- Divide if needed.  
- Pre-shape into balls or cylinders and let rest **20–30 minutes**. Tighten against counter.

### 4. Final Shape
- Gently stretch and roll into boule or baguette shapes. Final shaping should be tight as it helps with oven spring. 
- Place on parchment or a floured couche. I use a stainless steel bowl with a kitchen towel to help hold the dough in shape as it goes through the final proof.

### 5. Proofing
- Let dough proof until slightly puffy and relaxed.

### 6. Scoring & Spritzing
- Score with a sharp blade at a shallow angle.  
- Lightly mist with water for crispy crust.

### 7. Baking
- Preheat a Dutch oven (or baking stone/steel) to **500°F (245°C)**.
- Place the dough on parchment paper and carefully set in the Dutch oven.
- Lower oven temperature to **410°F (210°C)**.
- Bake covered for **25 minutes**, then uncover and bake **20-25 minutes** more until golden.

### 8. Cooling
- Allow to cool fully after removing from the oven.
