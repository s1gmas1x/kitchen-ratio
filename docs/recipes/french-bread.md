## Procedure

### 1. Mixing
- Combine flour, water, salt, and yeast until a rough dough forms.  
- No kneading needed—just hydrate thoroughly.

### 2. Bulk Fermentation (Cold)
- Cover the bowl and place in the refrigerator for **12–18 hours**.
- **Perform 2–3 folds every 30 minutes** during the first 1–1.5 hours.
- **Fold once more** 8–12 hours before baking (usually the morning of baking).

### 3. Pre-Shape
- Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface.  
- Divide if needed.  
- Pre-shape into balls or cylinders and rest **20–30 minutes**, tightening against counter.

### 4. Final Shape
- Gently stretch and roll into rough boule shapes.  
- Place on parchment or floured couche. Use a bowl and towel to help hold shape during proofing.

### 5. Proofing
- Let dough proof until slightly puffy and relaxed.

### 6. Scoring & Spritzing
- Score with a sharp blade at a shallow angle (a bread lame like this [Bread Lame](https://amzn.to/44Rh5TZ) works great).  
- Lightly mist with water for a crisp crust.

### 7. Baking
- Preheat a Dutch oven (or baking stone/steel, or something like this [Lodge Cast Iron Combo Cooker](https://amzn.to/4oLycOs)) to **480°F (249°C)**.
- Place dough on parchment and carefully set in Dutch oven.  
- Reduce oven temperature to **440°F (227°C)**.
- Bake covered **25 minutes**, then uncover and bake **20–25 minutes** more until golden.

### 8. Cooling
- Allow to cool completely before slicing.
