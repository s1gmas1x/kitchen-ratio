# No-knead Tortillas

Super easy, no-knead tortillas that can be ready in as little as 1 hour with minimal prep. Rolling is the only task that requires some attention, but the soft dough makes it very manageable. Use the [KitchenRatio Calculator](https://bread.ckohl.com) to scale to any batch.

## Background

After testing many recipes, I found most tortillas came out too thick or tore during rolling. This version uses boiling water to gelatinize the flour, keeping the dough soft and pliable.  

These tortillas are perfect for burritos, soft tacos, or serving alongside green chili and beans.

## Ingredients (Example Batch)
- **Flour** - 450g
- **Water** - 306g boiling water (68% hydration)
- **Fat** - 90g (20%)
- **Baking soda** - 9g (2%)
- **Salt** - ~7g (~1.6%)

::: info
I prefer lard, but any neutral fat works.  

- If using solid fat (lard, butter, shortening), melt it before combining with the hot water to maintain temperature.  
- Baking soda is used to increase the water pH and slightly reduce gluten development, which keeps the tortillas soft - it is **not for leavening**.

## Procedure

### 1. Mixing
- Boil and weigh the water.  
- Dissolve salt and baking soda in the hot water.  
- Add the fat and stir to combine.  
- Gradually add the flour while stirring until fully incorporated. The dough will be very loose.  
- Transfer to a container, cover, and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.

### 2. Divide
- Weigh the dough, then divide by desired portion size (45–47g yields ~12-inch tortillas).  
- Shape each portion into a small ball, tightening the surface against the counter, until the surface is smooth.  
- Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

### 3. Roll
- Remove from refigeration after at least 30 minutes.
- Preheat cast iron skillet on medium to high heat on the stove.
- Roll each ball in a bowl of flour, then smash flat with your hand.
- Sprinkle flour on the counter, roll each flattened ball as thin as you can get them. You should be able to get them almost paper thin and be able to see through them. Rotate and flip as needed to keep them round, and prevent them from sticking to the counter or the rolling pin.
- You should be able to stack these up, as long as they aren't too sticky or your kitchen isn't too humid.

### 4. Cook
- Place indivdual tortillas in the cast iron pan and cook.
- Cook for about 15-30 seconds, then flip and repeat twice for each side. Just get a kiss of brown on each side, don't overcook.
- Place on a plate or a pan when done and cover with foil or a kitchen towel. (Tortillas will soften up and finish cooking with the residual heat.)
- When all of the tortillas are finished flip the entire stack over to prevent the bottom tortilla from getting soggy.
- Leave these covered for 10-15 minutes before enjoying.
