# No-knead Tortillas

Super easy no-knead tortillas, these can be ready to cook in as little as 1 hour, with very little time to prepare. The hardest part is rolling them out, and since the dough is nice and soft, even this is not that hard. Use the [KitchenRatio Calculator](https://bread.ckohl.com) to scale to any batch.

## Background

I spent a long time trying to find the best tortilla recipe, most of the time they came out too thick and tore when rolling. This recipe uses boiling water to gel the flour keeping them soft, pliable and easy to roll.

These go great with green chili and beans, and also make great burritos or soft tacos.

## Ingredients (Example Batch)
- **Flour** - 450g
- **Water** - 306g boiling water (68% hydration)
- **Fat** - 90g (20%)
- **Baking soda** - 9g (2%)
- **Salt** - ~7g (~1.6%)

::: info
I use lard for these, but you may use oil for a vegan option. 

If using a solid fat like lard, butter, or shortening, melt it in the microwave until it's fully melted this will help keep the water hot when adding the flour. It is important that the water is as hot as possible when you add the flour.
