# Colorado Style Pizza Dough

A cold-fermented dough inspired by the original Fargo’s Pizza Co. recipe. This version develops a malty depth of flavor and a tender, crisp crust. It’s optimized for home baking while staying true to the original style. Use the [KitchenRatio Calculator](https://calculator.kitchenratio.com) to scale to any batch size.

## Background

When I worked at Fargo’s Pizza Co., I didn’t have access to the exact formula, but I worked with the dough every day for nearly 20 years. This recipe is based on that experience, along with a few adjustments I’ve always felt improved it.

The original dough used a slightly **lower hydration**, which worked well with a commercial dough sheeter. For home baking, increasing hydration improves:

- Extensibility  
- Handling (without a sheeter)  
- Crust texture - lighter, less dense, and more open

If you want something closer to the restaurant version, simply reduce the hydration.  
If you drop it **below 65%**, I recommend kneading for **8–10 minutes** after mixing.

## Ingredients (Example Batch)

- **Flour** - 550g  
- **Water** - 363g (66% hydration)  
- **Yeast** - 1.6g (0.3%)  
- **Olive oil** - 39g (7%) 
- **Salt** - 11g (2%) 
- **Light malt powder** - 11g (2%)

::: info
This batch makes **about three 11-inch (“Medium”) pizzas** depending on how thick you make the crust. I usually stretch mine to about 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick before adding toppings.

The low yeast percentage (0.3%) slows fermentation during the long cold rise -  
**24 hours bulk fermentation**, followed by **24–48 hours cold proofing**.

## Procedure

### 1. Mixing
- Combine all ingredients until a rough, cohesive dough forms.
- If using active dry yeast add to water for about 10 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  
- Intensive kneading isn’t necessary at this hydration level.

> [!NOTE]
> You have two options for adding the oil:
> - **Add it during mixing** - easiest, but may slightly affect gluten development.  
> - **Add it after the two folds** - better gluten formation, but requires kneading the oil in.
>
> If adding it later:  
> The dough may temporarily look like it’s coming apart when you begin kneading in the oil. This is normal. Stay patient and continue pressing the dough with your palms, folding, rotating, and pressing again. It will come back together faster than it seems.

### 2. Bulk Fermentation (Cold)
- Place the dough in the refrigerator for **24 hours**.  
- Perform **2 gentle folds** within the first hour to strengthen the dough:
  - Mix the dough and place it in the refrigerator.  
  - After 30 minutes, remove, perform one fold, and return to the fridge.  
  - After another 30 minutes, perform the second fold and refrigerate.
- If you delayed adding the oil, add it after the folds. Let the dough rest a few hours, then knead in the oil just before leaving it to rest overnight.

### 3. Final Proof
- Divide and shape into dough balls. Streching the balls against the counter to tighten.
- Place the balls into a tray, or separate containers with a bit of olive oil to prevent sticking.  
- Cold proof for **24–48 hours** for the best flavor and extensibility.

### 4. Shaping
- Allow the dough balls to warm before shaping. Remove from refigeration for 1-2 hours.  
- Gently press and stretch into rounds while preserving gas in the dough.  
- Use your fingertips to press outward in a circular pattern, leaving a slight ridge around the edge.  
- Avoid over-degassing as it affects texture.  
- Top with sauce and ingredients, being careful not to overload the dough.

:::info
You will want to move the pizza to a paddle or a peel before topping, put down plently of flour or cornmeal to prevent sticking. 

Put it on the edge of the peel so it slides off easily onto the stone or steel in the oven.
:::

### 5. Baking
- Preheat your oven as hot as it will go:
  - Most home ovens reach **450–500°F**  
  - Some can reach **500–550°F**
- Bake on a pizza stone or steel until the crust is golden and crisp.
